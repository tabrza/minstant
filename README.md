## Assignment instructions
  In this peer assessment you will be working on an instant messaging app called minstant!
  You are provided with a working starter application and you have to use the skills you have learned in the course to improve the application in various ways.
  You should download and run the starter application, then test it out by logging in as different users in two different web browsers at the same time, and seeing if the users can talk to each other. It creates a set of test user accounts automatically, so you can log in as user1@test.com ... user8@test.com with the password test123.

## Tasks

### 1. Improve the look and feel
   - Adapt the templates and helper functions so that the messaging window displays usersâ€™ avatars next to their messages. Feel free to add other enhancements!

### 2. Implement data writing security
   - Remove the insecure package from the application and implement a Meteor method to allow the insertion of chat items in the Chats collection. Test that you cannot insert items directly any more.

### 3. Implement data reading security
   - Remove the autopublish package from the application and implement publish and subscribe for Chats. Users should only be able to retrieve chats that have their user id in either the user1Id field or the user2Id field. Test by logging in as different users and checking what you can see.

### 4. Challenge: Implement emoticons
   - Can you implement emoticon functionality which allows the user to insert graphical emoticons into their message? Emoticons are small icons such as smiley faces which are typical of this kind of application.
